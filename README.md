Sleep disorders significantly impact personal well-being and societal health. This study explores the potential of a machine learning approach, specifically Random Forests, in predicting sleep disorders using sleep health and lifestyle data. We aim to build a model that can effectively classify individuals with and without sleep disorders based on their sleep patterns, daily habits, and other relevant factors. By leveraging this model, we hope to gain insights into the relationship between lifestyle choices and sleep health, ultimately contributing to early identification and intervention for sleep disorders. The study will involve data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The results will be analyzed to assess the model's accuracy, identify key features influencing sleep disorder prediction, and explore potential applications in sleep health management.
